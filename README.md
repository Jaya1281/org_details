Created two branched named feature1 and feature2
To merge a feature branches into the master branch using the git pull command, you can use the following steps:

Make sure you are on the master branch locally by running git checkout master.

Use the command git pull to fetch the latest changes from the remote repository and merge them into your local master branch.

Use the command git pull origin feature1 to pull the feature branch into the local master branch.

Resolve any merge conflicts that may occur.

Use the command git push to push the changes to the remote repository.

Check the status of the master branch on GitHub to confirm that the feature branch has been merged successfully.

Alternatively, instead of git pull, you can use git merge to merge a feature branch into the master branch. The command git merge feature2 will merge feature2 branch into the master branch.
